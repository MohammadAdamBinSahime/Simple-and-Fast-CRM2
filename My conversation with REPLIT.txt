payment option must appear only after free trial end, but inform user that they must pay after their free trial ends

I'll update the billing page to hide payment options during the active trial and inform users they need to pay after:
I've updated the billing page. Now payment options only appear after the free trial ends, and during the trial there's a clear message that payment will be required (RM59.99/month) after it ends. Does this look correct?

I'll add support for vertical reordering within columns. This requires updating the Kanban board to track item positions:
The Kanban currently supports dragging deals between columns (stages). Adding vertical reordering within the same column requires database changes. Would you like me to add this feature, or is moving deals between stages enough for your needs?

I'll make sure the horizontal drag between columns is working properly. Let me verify the current implementation is functional:
The Kanban drag and drop between columns (stages) is working. I can see deals are successfully moving between Lead, Qualified, etc. Is there anything else you'd like me to fix?

I'll add a subscription check that redirects to billing when the trial has ended and there's no subscription:
I've added the redirect logic. Now when a user's free trial ends and they don't have an active subscription, they will be automatically redirected to the billing page. Does this work correctly for you?

I see the issue. The `/api/billing/trial` endpoint is returning "User not found" which is causing problems with the redirect logic. Let me fix the trial endpoint to work with UAT mode:

I'll disable UAT mode and switch back to normal authentication:
I've disabled UAT mode and the app now uses normal authentication. You should be able to log in and use the app normally. When your free trial ends and you don't have a subscription, you'll be redirected to the billing page. Is the app working now?

Wait, in the email section it should show the email that is currently in use

I see the problem now. The hidden inactive tabs still have `flex-1`, which takes up space. Let me fix this by only applying `flex-1` to active tabs:
I fixed it so only the active tab takes up space. The inactive tabs are now properly hidden. Does the layout look correct now?

still same issue:

Let me check the logs and investigate why the production app isn't recognizing the subscription:

Checked console and system logs
I understand now - the development and production environments use separate databases. The dev database is updated, but the production database still has old data.

Let me check the subscription verification logic:

I see the issue now. Development and production use separate databases. My fix to the development database doesn't affect production.

The solution is to make the subscription check more robust by querying Stripe directly. Let me update the billing subscription endpoint to look up by email if the database doesn't have the subscription info:

I'll add a method to check Stripe directly by email as a fallback, and auto-sync the database when a subscription is found:

Now let me update the subscription endpoint to use this fallback and auto-sync:

I've added a fallback mechanism that:

Checks the database first for your Stripe subscription ID
If not found there, queries Stripe directly using the subscription ID
If still not found, looks up your subscription by email directly from Stripe
Auto-syncs your database with the correct Stripe customer and subscription IDs when found
This will fix the issue where production and development databases are out of sync. When you visit the billing page in production, it will now:

Query Stripe directly to find your active subscription by email
Automatically update your production database with the correct info
Please publish the app to deploy this fix to production. Once published, visit the billing page - it will automatically find your subscription by email from Stripe and sync your production database.

Improve subscription fetching by adding Stripe fallback
